### Resources
- Implementations of **FUnIE-GAN** for underwater image enhancement
- Simplified implementations of **UGAN** and its variants ([original repo](https://github.com/cameronfabbri/Underwater-Color-Correction))
- Implementation: TensorFlow >= 1.11.0 and Keras >= 2.2 (Python 2.7)

### Usage
- Download the data, setup data-paths in the training-scripts
- Use paired training for FUnIE-GAN / UGAN, and unpaired training for FUnIE-GAN-up 
- A few saved models are provided in models/
- Use the test-scripts for evaluation
